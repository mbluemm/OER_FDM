<h2> A Mad Tea-Party </h2>

<p>
There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. 'Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice; 'only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind.'</p>

<!-- style="text-indent: 2em;"-->
<p>
The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: 'No room! No room!' they cried out when they saw Alice coming. 'There's plenty of room!' said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.

> Mad Tea Party

<p>'Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.
Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. 'I don't see any wine,' she remarked. <br>
'There isn't any,' said the March Hare.</p>

<p>'Is that the way you manage?' Alice asked.
The Hatter shook his head mournfully. 'Not I!' he replied. 'We quarrelled last March -- just before he went mad, you know --' (pointing with his tea > spoon at the March Hare,) ' -- it was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing </p>

<p id="indent">"Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
How I wonder what you're at!"</p>

<p id="indent">You know the song, perhaps?'
'I've heard something like it,' said Alice.
'It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, 'in this way:--

- "Up above the world you fly,
- Like a tea-tray in the sky.
- Twinkle, twinkle--"'
